      <p>The Caesar Cipher is a cipher named after Julius Caesar. Known as one of the most simplest and common ciphers, the Caesar cipher is a subsitution cipher. 
        The cipher replaces each letter in a plaintext with another letter from a fixed position along the alphabet. The picture above shifts each letter with the key of 3. This shifts a -> c, b -> d, c -> e, and so on.

      <h1>Morse Code</h1>
          <img src="morseCode.png" alt="Morse code pic"/>
      <p>Morse code is an encryption method that was created by American Artist Samuel Morse. Inspired by the on/off nature of the signals made from the electrical telegraph system, Samuel Morse developed the method to convert letters and numbers into a series of dots and dashes.
        Using the picture on the top, you can see how each letter and number is converted into Morse code.

          <!-- Vigenère cipher info -->
    <div class ="about-box">
      <h1>Vigenère Cipher</h1>
          <img src="vigenereCipher.png" alt="Vigenère cipher pic"/>
      <p>The Vigenère cipher is used as a more advanced version of the Caesar cipher to encrypt text. Using the same basis as the Caesar cipher, the Vigenère cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter whose increment is determined with a key.
        Unlike the Caesar cipher, the Vigenère cipher moves each plaintext letter by a different increment according to the key. For example, the plaintext can be apple, and the key can be orange; The result will be ogpyk.
        a -> o, p -> g, p -> p, l -> y, e -> k The first letter a is shifted 14 positions to o, the second letter p is shifted 18 positions to the letter g, and so on.
