The main goal of this project is to create a program that can encode a user input into a cipher with at least three different methods of encoding. It's as simple as writing up and inputting whatever you wish to encode and then choosing what method of encryption you want to use. 

The methods (for now) are going to be encryption through: converting the input to morse code (dots and dashes), encoding the input using a caesar cipher (shifting the letters up or down using a specific number as our key), and finally encoding the input using a vignère cipher (similar to a caesar cipher, but uses a code word. Each letter in the key word is a number on the alphabet. You shift the letters in the word you are encoding by the value of each letter in the key word).

For right now, that is the basic goal of the project. It's set up to potentially involve more methods of encryption, but the primary goal is to just have the three listed.
